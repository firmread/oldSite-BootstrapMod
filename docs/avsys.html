			Human percieved space and the world in combination of all our sensory inputs. Simultaneously process those input from what you see, hear, touch, taste, and smell, we make sense of the world. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Computer, on the other hand, percieved the world as binary numbers. There are things that is 1 and there are things that is 0. As we human become to involve with computer in much stronger relationship. We try to translate our ability to sense to this binary device. By doing so we have to break it down, draw a map of how these integer and float numbers should connect to output that make us feel.
