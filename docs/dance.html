			"Think of all your movements in life as dance movements. Breathe. Watch. Listen. Touch. And move between the earth and the sky." - Yoko Ono
		</p>
		<p>
			As a nerd, I don't dance much in my life, if I was at all. While my physical body might be quite static most of the time. It is these kind of poem that moves me. Allows me to romantize, write, and perform. Between the earth and the sky, indeed.

			The project is written in Processing and Max/MSP.
