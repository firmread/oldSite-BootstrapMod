			"We do political work when we are compelled to react to events. In some way you become political when you don't have a chance to be poetic. I think human beings would much prefer to be poetic. I think every human being would like to have peace, to enjoy life, to have good food, good sex, good wine, good friends and pleasure. Maybe this will never be possible... Maybe wehave a need to know the truth." - Cildo Meirelse, A Brazilian artist

			In late 2011, Thailand suffers from a major flooding that was estimated by World Bank to be the fourth costliest disaster as of 2011 surpassed only by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, 1995 Kobe earthquake, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It was a slow and painful disaster that last about 6 months as the water was slowly progress down the hill to the capital, Bangkok at the river ends.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, there is one political prisoner, Ampon Tangnoppakul, who is imprisons for being accused to send four text message to one secretary of politician in Thailand with rude words on Royal Family. With not even enough evidence nor able to prove that this Chinese-root old man had enough technology literacy to send those SMS, the court imprisons him and not allow to bail out. This case raise the voice of Thai political activist and progressive thinking/writer to run a campaign against Lèse-majesté law. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of the severe flood, the campaign was interupted and discredited by pro-royalists as irrelevant during the disaster. 2011 flooding in Thailand had not only made physical, financial, mental, damage to the country but it also took away common sense and human rights from us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tangnoppakul died in the jail the following year and never had a chance to prove his innocence or hug his grandchild and lover for one last time. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The project is written in OpenFrameworks (C++) for iOS.
