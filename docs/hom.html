			Hom (overlay, urban blanket) is a conceptual architectural design for public space. It is our attempted to answer a question of how people interact with architecture in the age of mobile technology. Hom envisioned an interactive space where it expands or contracts its form, depends on human behaviour and needs at that specific times. It involved a portable tensile fabric structure that loosely define the needs and allows customization and transformation when the user what to shared or be isolated.
