			Simulation x Simulation is a meta-level simulation card game that simulates a group of fictional design students named Firm, Paul, Jean, Soo, and Terese. While they struggling over designing a simulation game for their game design class. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The group have a lot of conflicts, as Soo a serious designer wanted to creates a serious market simulation that is no where near fun but sounds great on portfolio. While Paul only cares about crazy stuffs that sounds fun for him. And he also occasionally express his desire to design a game with sexual references, regardless of the fact that three members out of five of this group are women. And Firm who is secretly planning to throw every ideas out of the windows and save the day. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are also external problems such as Sandy Storm that stop the trains from running, as deadline for final projects for all other  classes approaching. How would this game design assignment would turns out to be in the end?  
		</p>
		<p>
			Play this card game to find out.
