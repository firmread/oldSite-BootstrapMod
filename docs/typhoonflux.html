			Typhoon/flux is a collective of designer and developers that share interest in intersection of playful experience and urban environment.

			We explored the 10 Avenue Square on High Line Park. As it is a great representation of layering urban environment that can be found through out the world. Yet the site provide unique affordance for passer by to become a spectator of the city. While most people on the street level wouldn't notice that observation at all. We intervened the site with a simple game that raise a question between state of spectatorship, participatory and play.
